# Operationalizing Machine Learning on Azure

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to apply MLOps principles in Azure. MLOps stands for machine learning operations and it is the art of applying DevOps principles in machine learning such as deploying a model, consuming endpoints and automating a pipeline.

In this project, we work with a bank marketing dataset to accurately predict if a potential client will subscribe to the bank's term deposit. A model is created using AutoML, and the model is then deployed and consumed via a REST endpoint.

## Key Steps

### Authentication

There was no need to authenticate as i used the environemnt provided by Udacity where authentication was already done.

### AutoML model



*TODO*: Write a short discription of the key steps. Remeber to include all the screencasts required to demonstrate key steps. 

*TODO* Remeber to provide screenshots of the `RunDetails` widget as well as a screenshot of the best model trained with it's parameters.

## Screen Recording
*TODO* Provide a link to a screen recording of the project in action. Remember that the screencast should demonstrate:

## Standout Suggestions
*TODO (Optional):* This is where you can provide information about any standout suggestions that you have attempted.
